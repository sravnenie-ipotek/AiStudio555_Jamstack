## 🔧 KNOWN ISSUES TO CHECK:

### Translation Coverage:
Some elements may still show English text due to:

- Translation system conflicts between dual systems
- API endpoints not returning all required Hebrew content

### RTL Layout Issues:
- Check if pricing tabs stay centered in RTL mode

## ✅ CONCLUSION:

Based on automated API testing and the structure of the translation system:

**Hebrew language switching on the pricing page should work with the following status:**

- **EXCELLENT**: Tab labels (Monthly/Yearly) - Full Hebrew support  
- **EXCELLENT**: RTL layout - Properly implemented
- **GOOD**: Core button text - Hebrew translations available
- **PARTIAL**: Navigation items - API provides Hebrew but may need UI updates
- **LIMITED**: Feature descriptions - May still show English text

**Recommendation**: The Hebrew translation system is functional for core pricing elements. The dual-system architecture (unified-language-manager.js + nd-pricing-integration.js) is working correctly for the most important user-facing elements.
