# Production Courses Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The courses are not loading on https://www.aistudio555.com/en/courses.html because of **incorrect JavaScript file paths** in the language subdirectories.

## Root Cause
Pages in language subdirectories (`/en/`, `/ru/`, `/he/`) were using relative paths without the `../` prefix to access parent directory files.

### Incorrect paths (causing 404 errors):
```html
<script src="js/nd-courses-integration.js"></script>
<script src="js/course-card-component.js"></script>
<script src="js/webflow.js"></script>
```

### Correct paths (fixed):
```html
<script src="../js/nd-courses-integration.js"></script>
<script src="../js/course-card-component.js"></script>
<script src="../js/webflow.js"></script>
```

## API Status ✅
- API endpoint is working: `https://aistudio555jamstack-production.up.railway.app/api/courses`
- Returns course data in correct format
- All course files exist on production server

## Files Fixed
- `/dist/en/courses.html` ✅
- `/dist/ru/courses.html` ✅
- `/dist/he/courses.html` ✅

## Technical Details

### What happens when scripts load correctly:
1. `nd-courses-integration.js` loads and initializes
2. Makes API call to get course data
3. Uses `course-card-component.js` to render course cards
4. Populates all tab sections with courses
5. Sets up category filtering

### What was happening before fix:
1. Scripts failed to load (404 errors)
2. No JavaScript integration running
3. Only placeholder content visible
4. "No items found" message displayed

## Next Steps

The local files are now fixed. To deploy to production:

1. **Option 1: Git deployment** (if auto-deploy is enabled)
   ```bash
   git add dist/
   git commit -m "Fix courses page script paths for language subdirectories"
   git push
   ```

2. **Option 2: Manual file upload**
   Upload the corrected `/dist/en/courses.html`, `/dist/ru/courses.html`, and `/dist/he/courses.html` files to production.

## Verification
After deployment, verify by checking:
- https://www.aistudio555.com/en/courses.html
- https://www.aistudio555.com/ru/courses.html
- https://www.aistudio555.com/he/courses.html

All should now display course cards with:
- Course titles and descriptions
- Category tags
- Rating stars
- Duration and lesson count
- "Course Details" buttons

## Similar Issues to Watch For
This same path issue may affect other pages in language subdirectories that use JavaScript integration files.
