## ✅ COMPLETED COMPONENTS

### Database Tables
```sql
✅ nd_home      - Home page sections (hero, features, etc.)
✅ nd_menu      - Navigation menu items
✅ nd_footer    - Footer content and links
```

### API Endpoints
```javascript
✅ GET  /api/nd/home-page       - Fetch home page content
✅ GET  /api/nd/menu            - Fetch menu items
✅ GET  /api/nd/footer          - Fetch footer content
✅ PUT  /api/nd/home-page/:section_key - Update section
✅ PATCH /api/nd/home-page/:section_key/visibility - Toggle visibility
```

### Frontend Files
```
✅ /nd/index.html              - New design home page
✅ /js/nd-integration.js       - API integration script
✅ /admin-nd.html              - Admin panel
```

### Test Coverage
```
✅ tests/nd-full-e2e.spec.js   - Comprehensive E2E tests
✅ test-nd-frontend.js         - Frontend integration tests
✅ run-nd-tests.js             - Test runner
```

## 🔴 BLOCKERS & ISSUES

### Current Issues
1. **Port Conflicts** - Multiple servers trying to use same ports
   - Solution: Use PORT=3000 for API, 8080 for frontend
2. **Test File Path** - Playwright can't find nd-full-e2e.spec.js
   - Solution: Update test runner configuration

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ Database connection (used aistudio_db instead of postgres)
- ✅ API response structure (queryDatabase returns rows directly)
- ✅ Missing columns in nd_footer (added newsletter fields)
