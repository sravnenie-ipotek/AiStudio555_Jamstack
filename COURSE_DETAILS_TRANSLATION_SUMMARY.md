# Course Details Page Translation Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Translation System for detail_courses.html

### What was implemented:

1. **Database Table Created: `nd_course_details_page`**
   - Stores UI translations for the course details page
   - Supports EN, RU, HE languages
   - Contains sections: navigation, course_overview, what_you_learn, course_curriculum, requirements, course_features, course_info, instructor, cta, ui_elements, footer

2. **API Endpoint Added: `/api/nd/course-details-page`**
   - Located in server.js (lines 8253-8297)
   - Returns translations based on `?locale=` parameter
   - Supports preview mode with `?preview=true`

3. **HTML Updates to detail_courses.html**
   - Added `data-page="course-details"` attribute to body
   - Added data-i18n attributes to all translatable UI elements:
     - Navigation items
     - Section titles (Course Overview, What You'll Learn, etc.)
     - Sidebar labels (Lessons, Students, Level)
     - Buttons (Enroll Now, Start Learning, Browse Courses)
     - CTA section
   - Added language switcher pills (EN/RU/HE)
   - Included unified-language-manager.js

4. **Language Manager Integration**
   - Updated unified-language-manager.js to support course-details page
   - Added endpoint mapping for course-details page
   - Automatic language detection from localStorage

### How it works:

1. **UI Text Translation** (Static elements):
   - All buttons, labels, section titles come from `nd_course_details_page` table
   - Managed by unified-language-manager.js
   - Changes when user clicks EN/RU/HE pills

2. **Course Content** (Dynamic data):
   - Actual course data (title, description, price) comes from `nd_courses` table
   - Loaded by nd-course-details-integration.js
   - Uses course ID from URL parameter (?id=1)

### Testing Instructions:

```bash
# 1. Restart the server to load new endpoint
npm start

# 2. Open course details page
http://localhost:3005/detail_courses.html?id=1

# 3. Test language switching
- Click RU pill → UI elements translate to Russian
- Click HE pill → UI elements translate to Hebrew
- Click EN pill → UI elements return to English

# 4. Verify translations work for:
- Navigation menu items
- Section titles (Course Overview, What You'll Learn, etc.)
- Buttons (Enroll Now, Start Learning)
- Sidebar labels
```

### Files Modified:
- `/server.js` - Added API endpoint
- `/detail_courses.html` - Added data-i18n attributes and language pills
- `/js/unified-language-manager.js` - Added course-details page support
- `/js/nd-course-details-integration.js` - Updated API port to 3000

### Database Changes:
- Created table: `nd_course_details_page`
- 11 sections with full EN/RU/HE translations
- SQL file: `create-nd-course-details-page.sql`

### Important Notes:
- Server must be restarted after changes to server.js
- Course content (from nd_courses) may need separate translation
- Language preference persists across pages via localStorage
- Works with same unified system as home.html and courses.html

## Next Steps (if needed):
1. Add translations for actual course content in `nd_courses` table
2. Add more UI elements as needed
3. Test with real course data
4. Deploy to production (Railway)
